- This is a demake of the Gen 5 summary screen with some extra configuration and features. Please see the wiki link in the header hyperlink above for more information and credits.
- If you're using pokeemerald-expansion, you'll need to use [the expansion version](https://ravepossum.github.io/#bw_summary_screen_expansion) instead.

### [bsbob_map_popups](https://github.com/ravepossum/pokeemerald/tree/bsbob_map_popups)

- This is a port of BSBob's map pop-ups from [Vanadium Version](https://github.com/nielsmittertreiner/pokeemerald/tree/vanadium). If you pull this, please credit him.

### [expansion_flags_fix](https://github.com/ravepossum/pokeemerald/tree/expansion_flags_fix)
- This is a branch of pokeemerald that fixes all of the errors/warnings generated by the modern compiler using the strict compiler flags that pokeemerald-expansion uses.
- The primary use case for this branch is to pull in your pokeemerald feature branches and then build/test to find all errors that your branch will introduce if someone pulls the branch into pokeemerald-expansion.
- This is **NOT** a feature branch, and is not intended to be used as anything other than a development tool.

- This is a demake of the Gen 5 summary screen with some extra configuration and features. Please see the wiki link in the header hyperlink above for more information and credits.
- If you're using vanilla pokeemerald, you'll need to use [the vanilla version](https://ravepossum.github.io/#bw_summary_screen) instead.

### [hgss_dex_darkest_mode](https://github.com/ravepossum/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/hgss_dex_darkest_mode)
- This adds a *darkest* mode to the HGSS Pokedex and refactors the color modes of the HGSS dex to make it a bit easier to add new color schemes.
- Simply pull the branch and change `HGSS_COLOR_MODE` to select the color you want. You could make it an in-game option pretty easily too.

![darkest_mode_ss](https://github.com/ravepossum/ravepossum.github.io/assets/145081120/da141eb8-e83c-48a7-bfb1-99e3059f8bd8)

- **Please credit them and myself if you take advantage of any of these tools**.

### [debug_menu](https://github.com/ravepossum/pokefirered/tree/debug_menu)
- This is a port of TheXaman & RHH's pokeemerald-expansion overworld debug menu, minus any Expansion-specific functionality. By default it lives in the start menu instead of using the R+Start hotkey because of the help system.

### [battle_debug_menu](https://github.com/ravepossum/pokefirered/tree/battle_debug_menu)
- This is a port of RHH's pokeemerald-expansion battle debug menu, minus any Expansion-specific functionality. You can activate it by pressing Select in battle. You press Start to advance to the next battler (not L&R like Expansion because of the help system).

![battle_debug_demonstration](https://github.com/ravepossum/ravepossum.github.io/assets/145081120/1421f327-be44-4b83-b17d-e6b38a6eb39d)

- This is the full set of [Poffin Case's FRLG overworlds](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/tree/main/Overworld%20Trainer%20Sprites/Poffin_Case) with the following changes:
    - All sprites use vanilla palettes
    - All sprites are named like the original file and in the right location (every single vanilla overworld NPC sprite is included, besides unused sprites)
    - Some sprites have been altered or recolored to more closely match the original sprites
- See the `README.MD` in the Asset Repo for more details.

## [Emerald Beyond](https://github.com/ravepossum/emeraldextra)

This is my WIP decomp hack based on [RHH's pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion) and [pret's pokeemerald](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) project.

The goals of the hack are as follows:
- Create an expanded version of Emerald offering modern features, convenience, and additional content
- Create a wealth of player choice through customization and options
- Create a world that feels more real and alive through dynamic and time-based events
- Maintain the feel and polish of an official game
